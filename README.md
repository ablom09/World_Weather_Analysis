# World_Weather_Analysis

Our project is in essence collecting and analyzing weather data across the globe for the purpose of recommending hotels for a prospective consumer that wishes to travel. In order to complete this goal, our project is broken down into several subsequent stages: data collection, narrowing our focus, and finally creating a recommended route.

The first step is relatively forward, a prospective traveler simply generates a range of temperatures for which they find ideal. In the example shown, a minimum temperature of 60 degrees was selected with a maximum of 80 degrees. However, it should be noted that any temperature ranges can be selected using the code shown.

Following this input of preferences, our program then in essence displays a map of all cities which full within these temperature ranges. This helps the consumer in question to figure just where in the world they wish to travel.
